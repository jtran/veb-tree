# veb-tree

**Status:** This is a personal project for learning that's not well-tested and
probably incorrect.

An implementation of the [van Emde Boas tree][veb-tree], a fast map
data-structure with integer keys.

[veb-tree]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Emde_Boas_tree

### Details

This strives to implement an interface similar to [BTreeMap][btree-map-docs] in
the standard library.

_u_ is the size of the key universe.  For example, if your key needs to be any
64-bit integer, then _u_ = 2<sup>64</sup>.  _n_ is the number of items in the
tree, each in the range [0, _u_ - 1].

The current implementation uses _O_(_n_ * _log_(_log_(_u_))) space.

Operation|Runtime|
---|---
Insert|_O_(_log_(_log_(_u_)))|
Remove|_O_(_log_(_log_(_u_)))|
Lookup|_O_(_log_(_log_(_u_)))|
Successor, Predecessor|_O_(_log_(_log_(_u_)))|
Minimum, Maximum|_O_(1)|

For perspective on what these bounds mean: _log_<sub>2</sub>(_log_<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>64</sup>)) = 6 ðŸ¤¯

![Single Run of Successor Comparison with BTreeMap](/doc/successor_single_comparison.svg)

In the graph above, lower is better.  The x-axis is the number of items in the
tree.  The successor operation is run a single time.

The graph shows that the van Emde Boas tree does less work due to the
_log_(_log_(_u_)) bound.  However, that's not the whole story.

![Multiple Runs of Successor Comparison with BTreeMap](/doc/successor_multiple_random_order_comparison.svg)

In the above graph, lower is better.  The x-axis is the number of items in the
tree.  The successor operation is run on 100,000 different keys, with keys in
random order.

The graph shows that the runtime for the van Emde Boas tree levels off since
it's proportional to the key size _u_, not the number of items in the tree _n_.
BTreeMap's runtime, on the other hand, continues to grow with _n_.  However, the
standard library's BTreeMap is optimized well, is very cache friendly, and is
faster overall, even with 40 million entries.

### Features

This library has the following features:

- 100% Safe Rust
- No runtime dependencies besides the standard library

Future work:

- More tests
- Benchmarks
- Convenience methods
- Iterators
- Reduce space usage to _O_(_n_)
